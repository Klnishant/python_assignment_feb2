Q1. Explain with an example each when to use a for loop and a while loop.
Ans--> A for loop is used when you want to repeat a set of statements a known number of times. For example, you may want to print the numbers 1 to 10:
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)

A while loop, on the other hand, is used when you want to repeat a set of statements an unknown number of times, until a certain condition is met. For example, you may want to print numbers from 1 to 10, but stop when you reach a number greater than 5:
i = 1
while i <= 10:
    print(i)
    if i > 5:
        break
    i += 1
